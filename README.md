# Quick history
EOL (Expression Oriented Language) -  a programming language developed at the Institute of Mathematical Machines in 1965–1966 under the supervision of Leon Łukaszewicz. Developed versions EOL-1, EOL-2, and EOL-3. Documentation here focuses mostly on EOL-2 implementation.

# Why?
Why am I creating this repository? For fun. I had some time off.<br>
I'm sorry that it isn't a lot, but it's REALLY hard to find ANY materials (at least for me).<br>
Sorry for the bad quality of the files. I had to reduce their size because of how GitHub works.

# English
If you don't know Polish, the English materials are in files:
- EOL — a_symbol_manipulation_language
- EOL_programming_examples_-_a_primer\_(Leon_Lukaszewicz, Jurg_Nievergelt)
- EOL_report_(Leon_Lukaszewicz, Jurg_Nievergelt)
- ICR_Quarterly_Report_no.15_1967
- Symbol_Manipulation_Languages_(P._W._Abrahams)

This time there is actually a lot of them, probably partly thanks to work of some US scientists on EOL-3.

# Thanks
I would like to thank especially all of the authors of the documents, redactors and helpers. <br>

If you have any information about EOL not included here, any good suggestion, or something to tell or ask me, feel free to send me an e-mail.
Oh, and keep tuned, soon there will be also a repository about SAS. I have almost all sources, just one in Wrocław left.
