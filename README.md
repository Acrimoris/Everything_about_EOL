# Quick history
EOL (Expression Oriented Language) - 

# Why?
Why am I creating this repository? For fun. I had some time off and was bored.<br>
I'm sorry that it isn't a lot, but it's REALLY hard to find ANY materials (at least for me)<br>
Sorry for the bad quality of the files. I had to reduce their size because of how GitHub works.

# English
If you don't know Polish, the English materials are in files:
- EOL — a_symbol_manipulation_language
- EOL_programming_examples_-_a_primer\_(Leon_Lukaszewicz, Jurg_Nievergelt)
- EOL_report_(Leon_Lukaszewicz, Jurg_Nievergelt)
- ICR_Quarterly_Report_no.15_1967
- Symbol_Manipulation_Languages_(P._W._Abrahams)

This time there is actually a lot of them, probably mostly thanks to work of University of Illinois on EOL-3, but definitely the most thanks to, once again, Leon Łukaszewicz.

# Thanks
I would like to thank especially all of the authors of the documents, redactors and helpers. <br>

Authors:
- Leon Łukaszewicz
- Jurg Nievergelt
- P. W. Abrahams
- Ryszard Łukaszewicz
- Iwona Hessner
- Jan Walasek
- Zdzisława Wrotek

And big "Thank you" to all libraries and online archives containing files and documents.
